TESS: At any rate, we have some apricot croissants leftover from today. Why don't you bring them to her as a peace offering?

TESS: I'm sure at least Bast will love them.
BELFRY: Who?

TESS: Briar's best mate? Bast?
BELFRY: Which one was Bast again...?
TESS: The furless cat?? Wears a lot of black?

BELFRY: Oh, yes! I think I remember her.

BELFRY: ... gosh, I really _haven't_ been paying enough attention to other creatures...
