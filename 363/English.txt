PARSLEY: Alright, that's enough of that! You've listened to my drivel enough for one day!
MARIE: You know I'm happy to listen to your troubles any time you need!

PARSLEY: Yeah, but someone's gotta listen to *yours*. How are *you* doing?
[SFX: doki doki]

MARIE: Oh... you know... Worried about Tamberlane and Jonas. Nothing much to say on that.
[SFX: doki doki doki]
PARSLEY: You can say all you like to me, Mar-Mar.

MARIE: Mar-Mar? You haven't called me that in a long time, *Par-Par.*
CORIANDER: *ELLIS! GET BACK HERE! ELLIS!!*
PARSLEY: Well, I have to do *something* to cheer you up, don't I?

CUR: *NOT ON YOUR BLEEDIN' LIFE!*

CORIANDER: *EAT THE MASH, ELLIS*
PARSLEY: The Carver household has officially lost its marbles.
MARIE: Don't worry, Par-Par. We'll figure something out.
