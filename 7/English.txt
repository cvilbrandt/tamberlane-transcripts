AINSLEY: GHOST! In the woods!

OFFSCREEN: Barely escaped with my life!!
ANTHONY: Piper!

AINSLEY: Just the most <em>dreadful wailing</em>...
PIPER: What kind of ghost?
ANTHONY: Piper, don't be rude!

PIPER: Did it have big bitey teeth?
ANTHONY: Piper.

ANTHONY: Piper!
PIPER: You should know, I <em>am</em> a professional ghost-catcher.

ANTHONY: Pip-
PIPER: ANTHONY, <em>WHAT!</em>

ANTHONY: Quit it! Can't you see they've already gone through a lot?

TESS: Why don't you ask Walter to bring Ainsley a cuppa?
PIPER: My talents are wasted.
