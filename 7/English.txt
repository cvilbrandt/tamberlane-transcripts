AINSLEY: In the ***woods!***

ANTHONY: *Piper!*
AINSLEY: ***Barely escaped with my life!!***
[SFX: jingle, jangle]

AINSLEY: Just the most *dreadful wailing...*
PIPER: What kind of ghost?
ANTHONY: Piper, don't be rude!

PIPER: Did it have big bitey teeth?
ANTHONY: Piper.

ANTHONY: Piper!
PIPER: You should know, I *am* a professional ghost-catcher.

ANTHONY: Piper-
PIPER: ANTHONY, ***WHAT!***

ANTHONY: Quit it!
ANTHONY: Can't you see they've already gone through a lot?

TESS: Why don't you ask Walter to bring Ainsley a cuppa?
PIPER: My talents are wasted.
