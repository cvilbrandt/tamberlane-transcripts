BELFRY: That's true... I just wish he'd let _us_ be those someones.

BELFRY: I've never seen him do this! He hasn't even _visited_ Tamberlane!

MILO: He did though.
BELFRY: What?
MILO: Visit her.

BELFRY: He did?? _When???_

MILO: The first night. When he came back, he wasn't acting like himself at all.

MILO: That was the last time I proper saw him.
MILO: And all your mum told me was there'd been some kind of confrontation.
