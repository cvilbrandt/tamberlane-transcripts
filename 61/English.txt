PIPER: Now, I can't help but notice that you're attempting to teach it how to walk.

PIPER: Rest assured, I am the *expert* at teaching things how to walk.
PIPER: I taught *Anthony* how to talk when *he* was an ickle baby kitten!

PENNY: I always thought Anthony was older than you.
PIPER: A common misconception. He's just *freakishly* tall, the poor lad.

PENNY: Wait, what's wrong with him, anyway?

PIPER: Oh, he's just paying his dues.
PIPER: I carried him for *months* as a kit.
PIPER: *Least* he can do is carry me now.
PIPER: Older sisters have it rough. You'll understand soon, Penny.

ANTHONY (muttered): tell mother i love her...
