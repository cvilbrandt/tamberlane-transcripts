CORIANDER: Ellis, half the town thinks I'm *starving* you. You're so thin! I'm worried about you!
CORIANDER: Isn't there *anything* you'll eat?

CUR: What do *you* care? It's not like you actually listen to me.
CORIANDER: I'm listening now.

CUR: What, if I say I'd only eat sweeties and biscuits, you'd be fine with it?
CORIANDER: If it would get you to eat, *yes!*

CUR: Yeah, you'd allow it *once*. Then you'd get all huffy 'bout eating "veggie-tables."
CORIANDER: I just want to ensure you're getting the proper nutrients!
CUR: *There* it is.

PARSLEY: Ow! What was *that* for??
MARIE: Ask him to hang out!

PARSLEY: Hang out?? *Why??*
MARIE: Cilantro helped you a lot when *you* went through a rough patch, right?
PARSLEY: Yeah?

MARIE: You've got to be a good big brother to Cur, too! He needs his own Cilantro!
