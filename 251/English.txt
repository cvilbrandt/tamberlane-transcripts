PARSLEY: Ah, sorry, luv! I was just tellin' her it was ducky to be different!
MARIE: Sorry, my Trissol is just *rubbish!*

PARSLEY: But speaking of Trissol, I know you must've been asked this oodles, Tam, but...
PARSLEY: How *did* you learn it?
PARSLEY: You en't hard-a-hearin', so... was it someone you knew?

TAMBERLANE: Um...
TAMBERLANE: Bee!

PARSLEY: Y'mean "V"?
TAMBERLANE: No, *Bee.*
PARSLEY: Yer signin' the letter "V", mate.

TAMBERLANE: Oh... Vee?
TAMBERLANE: You're right.

PARSLEY: Oh! You learned how to sign before you could talk out loud, didn't you?
PARSLEY: After all, you were only a baby when you were found.
PARSLEY: It's like learnin' how to pronounce a word from a book. It's hard to say 'em right, eh?
