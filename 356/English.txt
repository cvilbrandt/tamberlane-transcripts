BRIAR: I know you're trying, Belfry.
BRIAR: It's okay to be not okay.
BRIAR: But you can't put that on Tamberlane.

BRIAR: Remember how Mum used to do that?

BRIAR: She'd get so *angry*, and then she'd blame it all on us.

BRIAR: You know I love Mum, but she always said her temper was so short because you were a pawful to raise.
BRIAR: But she *used you* to avoid responsibility. Her temper was never your fault.

BRIAR: *You* can't be that way, Belfry! You can't put your problems on Tamberlane!
BRIAR: She takes on too much as it is!
BRIAR: I'll bet taking on *your stress* is why she pushed you away at Bally Bluffs!

BELFRY: *What would* ***you*** *know about what happened at Bally Bluffs?!*
