WALTER: So, how are you doing?
BRIAR: Fine.

WALTER: You don't look fine. You are looking... stretched thin.
BRIAR: I'm just frustrated! Why can't they just buck up and apologize already?

BRIAR: *WHAT?!* No they're not! They're polar opposites!

[SFX: SMACK]
TESS & BELFRY: *Hhmph!!!*
[SFX: SPLUT]

BRIAR: ...Nevermind. I see what you mean.
BRIAR (muttered, in [Russian]): (The apple doesn't fall far from the tree...)
