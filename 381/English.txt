HONEY: A trial doesn't mean he's guilty. It's just a _trial._
TIMMOTHY: But Callie said
HONEY: Recanted.

HONEY: The third Edict states that an educator must only teach approved curriculum.
HONEY: But Jentzen isn't a teacher; he's a Prentice.
HONEY: And he _wasn't_ teaching unapproved curriculum. He asked _Callie_ to do so.
HONEY: And she refused, as per the law.

TIMMOTHY: Even so, the fact that he encouraged her to break an Edict...
HONEY: All he encouraged was answering her student's questions.
TIMMOTHY: In violation of the third Edict!

HONEY: But since he didn't _teach_ them anything, he didn't do anything wrong.

TIMMOTHY: I don't know...
HONEY: What if we simply ask him to apologize in front of the kits? Tell them he was speaking as an ignorant Prentice and he's learned his lesson.

HONEY: We rule him not guilty, everyone comes away wiser, and no one has to be banished.
TIMMOTHY: That's not what a trial is for, Honey! We're to _investigate._ Not come at it with a verdict already in mind!
