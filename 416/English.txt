RENO: What?? What is it?

WANDERER: Ahhh, yes. I can see the impressionist influence.
RENO: A masterpiece.
WANDERER: It belongs in a museum.

BAST: Here. You two can fight over museum rights.
RENO: Brill!

BAST: Listen, Bri. Just trust your gut. I know you'll make the right call.
BRIAR: I'm not so sure, but... thank you.

RENO: Nah, mate, listen to Bast. She's the smart one.
WANDERER: I'm sure when you run into Belfry again, you'll know what to do.

WANDERER: Chin up, Briarpatch.
BAST: Don't forget that your friends are your family too.
