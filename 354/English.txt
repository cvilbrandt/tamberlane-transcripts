BRIAR: You are Tamberlane's *mum.* You have to stay strong for her.
BRIAR: You can't just lock yourself away from her!
BELFRY: That's not fair!

BRIAR: It doesn't matter what's *fair,* Belfry! You need to hear this!
BRIAR: Sometimes you just have to pull yourself together! Like for your kit!

BELFRY: Oh, just "pull myself together"? That's easy for *you* to say, Briar!
BELFRY: You don't know what it's like! Everything is *so hard,* all the time! And when I try, I mess it up! *Always!*

BRIAR: Belfry, STOP! You have to stop doing this!
BELFRY: *I know!* I'm trying to stop messing up, I *am!*
BRIAR: ***NO!***

BRIAR: You can't just say you're terrible at everything as an excuse to never work on anything!

BRIAR: You are *not* the world's most pathetic creature! You're *not* Mum's little waif anymore!
BRIAR: You are an adult and a *mother,* and you need to *stop* just flaking out whenever things get hard!
