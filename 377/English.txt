CUR: You start with yer game ring and a cross made o' mibs. That's the small marbles.
CUR: With yer taw - that's yer big marble - you shoot from outside the ring and try to knock out as many mibs as you can.

CUR: If yer taw goes out the ring, yer turn is done and you keep any mibs you knocked out!
CUR: But if yer taw stays in the ring, you can keep shooting from where it landed, so long as you knock a mib out each time. Oh, and not yer taw!

CUR: But you can also try an' knock your opponent's taw out the ring- oops!
MARIE: Ow!
CUR: I didn't see you there

PIPER: YOU'VE BULLIED YOUR LAST CREATURE!
PIPER: _I WON'T LET YOU HURT THEM LIKE YOU HURT TAMBERLANE!_
