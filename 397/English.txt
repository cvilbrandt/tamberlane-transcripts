AINSLEY: So you really haven't seen him either?
MILO: Well, I _assume_ he's not dead yet.

AINSLEY: _W-WHAT?!_
AINSLEY: _IS THAT LIKELY?! OH MY GODS WE HAVE TO HELP HIM_
MILO: _He's not dying!_

MILO: The tea stock keeps getting lower, so I _suspect_ he's just staying out of sight.
MILO: _Not_ dying.

MILO: Don't get me wrong.
MILO: I'm _glad_ he's alive down there.

MILO: I just can't believe he's gone and left me like this!!
MILO: I _do_ have a _due date_ for my thesis, you know!

MILO: He _must_ have found something in that book.
AINSLEY: Book? What book?
