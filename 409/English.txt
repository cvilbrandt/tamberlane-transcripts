RENO: Der, please.
RENO: You couldn't _possibly_ think that The Goose would lose against someone called _Snallygaster the Annihilator._
RENO: The Goose is the best fighter out of Rucchirrik!
WANDERER: But Snallygaster is from Tangled Branch.

WANDERER: He would have received more formalized training, a bespoke health regimen...
RENO: "Bespoke"? Nerd.

WANDERER: So _I_ think The Goose wouldn't stand a chance.
RENO: ***WHAT!*** Pit fighting isn't just _training!_

RENO: Pit fighting is about character! Strength! _Straight-up badassery!_
RENO: Who needs _training_ when you've _fought wild bears in Kryakvah?!_
RENO: That's all the _training_ you'd ever need right there!

WANDERER: John said The Goose didn't actually do that.
RENO: _You shut your heathen mouth, traitor!_

RENO: What does _the town minstrel_ know about _sports?!_
RENO: Has _John_ wrestled bears in Rucchirrik?! _I didn't think so!_
