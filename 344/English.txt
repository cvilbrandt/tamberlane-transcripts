GENEVIEVE: You can't be *serious*!
GENEVIEVE: He's my *son*!

HONEY: All the more reason we must be just.
HONEY: We must have no exceptions for Council members or their families.

TESS: But do we dare risk tearing a family apart over some *questions*?
TESS: We took over the Council to *stop* trials like that. Iyou ask me, we should *change* the Edicts.

TIMMOTHY: I understand your desire, Tess. Of course I do. But...
TIMMOTHY: You know as well as I do that the Edicts are from Parliament. They are *sacred*.
TIMMOTHY: It's not within our power to change them.

SCOTT: And I must remind you, Tess...
SCOTT: When you signed onto the Council, you swore to uphold the Edicts.
SCOTT: As did we all.

TESS: ...to trial, then.
GENEVIEVE: Yes... To trial.
