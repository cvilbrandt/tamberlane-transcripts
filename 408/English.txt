MILO: Say... Ainsley, you're a Scavenger...
AINSLEY: Yes?

MILO: Think you could help me find that book?

AINSLEY: I... don't know...

AINSLEY: What if he's hiding it for a reason?

MILO: Yes, but what if it's _dangerous?_ Why else would Uncle hide it?

OAKEWOOD: Oh, Jimmy...
OAKEWOOD: It's you, all over again...
