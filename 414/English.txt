WANDERER: There's no pressure, Briar. Take your time.
RENO: Yes... Let her come to you.

RENO: And anyway, you can't just cut creatures out of your life when they make mistakes.
WANDERER: You _know_ that's not what I meant!

WANDERER: If I got rid of creatures who annoyed the shit out of me, I'd have gotten rid of _you_ years ago.
RENO: Oh shiiiit, Der's getting _feisty!_

WANDERER: I'll show you feisty!
RENO: Do your worst!

BAST: Would you two just make out already?
BRIAR: _Whoa!!_
[SFX: rrgh!]
[SFX: oof!]

RENO: What d'you think, mate? Want to be my _lovaaaah?_
WANDERER: Oh Reno!
