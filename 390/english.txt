TESS: Why don't you catch Briar and her friends at Little Acorn?
TESS: I'm sure you both could use some quality sister time.

BELFRY: I don't know... We're kind of fighting.

BELFRY: Wait. Why is she at the summer camp? It's nearly Midwinter!

TESS: It's a lovely spot of land to spend time at, even when the camp is closed.
WALTER: Nothing like skipping rocks on the lake to clear a clouded mind.

TESS: I'm fairly sure the lake is frozen, Walter dear.
WALTER: ...Okay, maybe _throwing_ rocks on the lake clears a clouded mind?
