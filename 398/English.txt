MILO: It was some book he was reading when the cart got back from the trip.
MILO: When I told him about the accident, he _hid_ it from me.
AINSLEY: Whatever was in that book??

MILO: _How in the world should I know?!_
MILO: It's up and vanished along with him!!

MILO: But I'm _positive_ it had to do with Tamberlane.
MILO: I'd stake my _career_ on it.

[SFX: jingle jingle]
MILO: In fact, I _am_ staking my career on it! I _need_ whatever he found for my assignment!

MILO: But does he care? _Noooo!_
[SFX: tmp tmp tmp]

AINSLEY & MILO: He's still not come out.
