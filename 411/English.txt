RENO: Hey, you alright? You seem down.
RENO: Is it Tess?
BRIAR: Nah. I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

BAST: Ahhh, so it's Belfry, then.
BRIAR: Damn it, am I that transparent?

WANDERER: So what's up Bri?
BRIAR: I don't want to bring the mood down. You don't need me moping about my problems.
BRIAR: I'm fine, guys. Honestly.

RENO: Nope! No lying to _us,_ Briarpatch. Lay it on us.
RENO: Bonus: it will rinse out the taste of Der's godawful opinions on pit fighting.

WANDERER: Hey!
RENO: I welcome death.
