GENEVIEVE: You have to take a stand when the time is *right*, Jentzen, and this isn't the right time.
GENEVIEVE: Get through this and you can change *hearts* and minds *here!*
GENEVIEVE: You can help us work on ways to change the system!

GENEVIEVE: And just because there's going to be a trial doesn't even mean you're going to *lose!*
GENEVIEVE: We really *are* fair and just! I'll even be your counsel!

JENTZEN: I don't want your help.

JENTZEN: You taught me to stand up for what's right, but you won't do it for me.
GENEVIEVE: I told you, it's *complicated!*
JENTZEN: It's not.

JENTZEN: Get out of my room, please. I don't want to talk anymore.

GENEVIEVE: Okay.
GENEVIEVE: I love you, Jentzen.
