BRIAR: Nice to see you all at the Bat and Badger this morning.
BRIAR: Breakfast today is a mushroom and chervil quiche, or rosehip muffins if you have a sweet-tooth.
CORIANDER: Thank you kindly, Briar.

PARSLEY: That quiche sounds tops! A slice of that, please!

MARIE: Oh, I'd love one of those muffins!

CORIANDER: I'd love a little of each, truthfully!
CORIANDER: Ellis?

CUR: Nope.

CORIANDER: Ellis...
CUR: Sorry.
CUR: No *thank you*.

CORIANDER: *Ellis I am begging you to eat some breakfast*
ELLIS: Nah.
BRIAR: Right. I'll just... come back in a few.
