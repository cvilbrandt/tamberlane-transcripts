PARSLEY: Y'know, he's never let anyone near him...
PARSLEY: He was a rough sort already when Mum agreed to take him in.

PARSLEY: But this business at Bally Bluffs... it's like he got ten times worse overnight!

MARIE: He probably feels bad about what happened.
PARSLEY: Hah! Cur??
CUR: *GET THAT SPOON AWAY FROM ME, WOMAN!*
PARSLEY: He's been ravin' nonstop about how he'd do it again if given half a chance!
PARSLEY: I doubt he feels a lick of remorse.

CORIANDER: *ELLIS, EAT THE POTATOES!*
CUR: *HELP HELP SHE'S TRYIN TO POISON ME*
MARIE: Cur always seemed the sort to take out his pain on himself like that.

CORIANDER: *SIT! DOWN! YOUNG! MAN!*
CUR: *GERROFF ME!*
MARIE: Well, the one thing I *do* know is you can't give up.
MARIE: No matter how hard it gets. You *must* keep trying.

PARSLEY: Yeah... Yer right, as always. It's just...
CORIANDER: *I SWEAR TO THE SPIRITS YOU WILL NOT STARVE UNDER MY ROOF*
PARSLEY: Is it wrong to wish it didn't have to be us? Mum's on her last nerve, and I'm tired of listenin' to em argue.
CUR: *WATCH ME*
