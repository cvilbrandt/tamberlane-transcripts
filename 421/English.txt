BELFRY: I want to apologize for the row last week.
BELFRY: For the last forever, really.

BRIAR: No... I'm sorry, too. I shouldn't have blown up like that.
BRIAR: You've been dealing with a lot.

BELFRY: You were right, though. I'm _always_ dealing with a lot.
BELFRY: It's not an excuse.

BRIAR: Fair enough. But yelling at you's supposed to be Mum's deal, not mine.
BELFRY: I guess neither of us was our best self that night.

BRIAR: Thanks for giving me space to cool down, Bel.
BRIAR: I really needed it.
