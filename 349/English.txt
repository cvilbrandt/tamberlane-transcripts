TESS: And she just *dragged Tamberlane over?* Oxygen and all?
WALTER: да. But it turned out okay. Terra fixed little Tamberlane and Briar took Belfry home before worse could happen.
TESS: Oh, Belfry...

WALTER: Be strong, барсучка. Belfry is a very emotional creature. You know this.
TESS: I know, but it's not just Belfry. The meeting today...
TESS: It feels like everything is falling apart.

WALTER: Everything will be okay. This I promise you. Treehollow is full of good creatures.
WALTER: And Belfry will bounce back. She always does, poor waif.
TESS: I hope you're right, дорогой.
