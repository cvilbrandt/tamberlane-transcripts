CUR: I _KNEW_ THIS WAS A TRAP!
CUR: All that rubbish about havin' fun- all _LIES!_
CUR: _WELL BUGGER TO YOU TOO!!_

MARIE: _How could you do that to him??_ He didn't do a thing!
PIPER: What d'you mean?! He's _Cur!_ And he _hit_ you!
MARIE: Not on _purpose!_

PIPER: Who cares if it was on purpose?! Cur deserves it!
PARSLEY: No, Piper, he doesn't! Do you understand what you just did to him?!
PIPER: I _protected_ you!

PARSLEY: No, you drenched him in water when it's below freezing, and he's just skin and bones!
PARSLEY: If he gets pneumonia and dies, it's on _you!_
PIPER: Well... Well, it serves him right after he did the same to Tamberlane!
PIPER: Not to mention _his own friend!_

PARSLEY: Some creatures _make mistakes,_ Piper. I'm going after him.
PIPER: But _why?_
PIPER: It's _Cur..._
