BELFRY: ...What?
BRIAR: Well. Can't say I didn't try.

BELFRY: Wait, where are you going? We're not done!
BRIAR: *You're* not done. I'm very done.

BELFRY: Briar, wait! We have to work this out!

BRIAR: No, you have to work it out. I said everything I needed to say.
BRIAR: I'm done being your punching bag tonight.
BELFRY: Punching...?? Briar!

[SFX: DEEP sigh]

BRIAR: I love you so much, Belfry.
BRIAR: But I just need some space.
