GENEVIEVE: But Jentzen, the Edicts...
GENEVIEVE: We would love *nothing more* than to slide this under the rug.
GENEVIEVE: We *know* you didn't intend any harm. You were looking out for your students!
GENEVIEVE: But say we *did* ignore protocol this time...

GENEVIEVE: Your argument is public knowledge, Jentzen!
GENEVIEVE: You *know* word would get back to Parliament that we failed to uphold the Edicts!
GENEVIEVE: We would be removed from office, and *less* sympathetic creatures would be elected in our place.

GENEVIEVE: It's all a balancing act. We *couldn't* have done anything else in this position.
GENEVIEVE: But that doesn't mean I don't love you!
JENTZEN: Then you'll never take a stand?

JENTZEN: You won't even put your hoof down for what's *right?*
GENEVIEVE: Jentzen, of course I will! I *did!*

GENEVIEVE: Please, I'm trying to explain!
