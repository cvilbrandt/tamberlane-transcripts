BELFRY: Okay, yes, good idea! I'll go spend time with Briar and meet her mates _properly!_

BELFRY: But first, I _must_ try to get through to Oakewood again.

TESS: He really hasn't come out of his hole yet?? It's been _over a week!_
BELFRY: I'm _sure_ I can get through to him! I just have to keep trying.

WALTER: Tch, _Oakewood._ He is never present, yet his presence is never absent.

BELFRY: Wait, where?
WALTER: What?
TESS: Lord take pity on me.
