HONEY: Look. The Edicts protect the townsfolk, right?
TIMMOTHY: Certainly.
HONEY: I don't think we need to protect the town from _Jentzen._
TIMMOTHY: He's proved that we _might,_ though.

HONEY: He's a young adult, and still inexperienced. We've _all_ made mistakes.
TIMMOTHY: Not like this! What are we saying here, Honey? That you can escape being punished if we decide you _should be_ innocent?

HONEY: Timmothy, the very fact that he's on trial means he won't be able to escape this. A mistake like this sticks with you.
HONEY: He'll certainly never teach kits again.
HONEY: Do we really need to _banish_ him on top of it? To _mark_ him?

TIMMOTHY: But isn't that what marking is _for?_ To record your sins?

HONEY: I'd say that when everyone knows what you've done, that's already record enough.

HONEY: Some mistakes are like a rock in a pond. You can never undo the ripples you've caused.
