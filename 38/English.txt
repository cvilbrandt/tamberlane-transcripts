OAKEWOOD: Well. I'd like to get out of this rain. Officer Sawyer, I take it Doctor Nora is at home asleep?

SAWYER: Well, she said she'd be up, but she hasn't had a lot of sleep lately what with the new puppy so I'd rather let her sleep, if I can...
OAKEWOOD: Yeah, yeah. The leg'll hold til morning. She can stop by the library then.

HENRY: The library?

OAKEWOOD: Didn't you hear me, pup?

OAKEWOOD: I'm starting a new research project. They're staying with me.
BELFRY: We are?

TESS: YOU?
OAKEWOOD: You've made it abundantly clear you're not interested. Can't have it both ways, badger britches.

HENRY: This just gets worse and worse.
WALTER: Oh dear.
