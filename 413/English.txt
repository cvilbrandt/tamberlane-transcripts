WANDERER: Well, you said it yourself, mate. Something had to change.
WANDERER: She's always putting _so much_ on you.

WANDERER: It's not fair to you. You were right to stand up to her.
BRIAR: Sure, but like _that?_

RENO: Yeah, it sounded like a big blow-up, instead of a serious conversation.
BRIAR: Exactly. So I should forgive her, right?

WANDERER: You're under no obligation to forgive her, Briar.
RENO: Sure, but wouldn't it be better if she tried?
RENO: This town is the size of a walnut. They can't avoid each other forever.

BAST: How's Belfry been since the fight? Did she take your words to heart, or...?

BRIAR: Dunno. I haven't talked to her, to be quite honest.
