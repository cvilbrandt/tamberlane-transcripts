WALTER: All right, then?
TESS: Yes, I just...
TESS: I don't like that she keeps running off to _Claude_ of all creatures.

TESS: He pulls her in, props her up, fills her head with poison about _us..._
TESS: And then when she needs him most, he abandons her like a coward!
TESS: Why does she still care what he thinks?!

WALTER: Oakewood is like the tree he lives in. Deep roots, looks stable, but hollow inside. It is not her. It is him.
WALTER: Ever since Jimmy, the way he treats you...Долбоёб. He is selfish.

WALTER: You are right. Belfry needs stability. Claude is not stable. _Family_ is stable.
TESS: We must be there for them. Belfry, Briar. Tamberlane.

TESS: I'm so worried about all of them.
WALTER: Ah, my love. To love is to worry...
