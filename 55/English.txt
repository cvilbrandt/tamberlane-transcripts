FOX: So, how'd your first night as a parent treat you?
BELFRY: Oh, it's not *that* hard.

FOX: Oh, not that hard?
FOX: In true Belfry fashion, you chose the hardest kind of parenting there is.
FOX: Just you wait.

BELFRY: The hardest?
FOX: Adopted kits don't tend to attach very quickly.
FOX: If it takes her a bit to warm up to you, that's normal.

BELFRY: Oh, she took to me pretty much immediately!
FOX: Really?

[SFX: Achoo!]
BELFRY: Yes! She came right up and hugged me.
BELFRY: I think she could tell I was nice.

FOX: That's unusual behavior!
We really ought to keep an eye on her development.
