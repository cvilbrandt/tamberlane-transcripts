OFFSCREEN: ***BELFRY!***
BELFRY &amp; TAMBERLANE: *AAHH!*

FOX: How many claws am I holding up?
BELFRY: T...two?

FOX: Whew! When I'd heard you fell down a cliff, I was worried.
FOX: But as usual, you defy expectations in the best way.

FOX: Since you don't appear to be concussed, I'm going to let Terra get some experience treating you.

FOX: In the meantime, I'll feed Parker.
FOX: Hello, my love.
TERRA: He definitely wants his mama.
[SFX: weh mnnnwuh muh]

BELFRY: Oh ho, finally letting your prentice into the field?

TERRA: Maybe if you lot stopped falling down cliffs, Nora wouldn't need the extra paws!
