PANDADOG: Oh, darling, you're shivering!

SKUNK: Mum, they can wear my dress, if it'll help!
PANDADOG: That would be lovely, Marie! Thank you!

PANDADOG: Now, whom shall I return you to?

TAMBERLANE: ...ummm...

TAMBERLANE: Pawsley!

MARIE: Oh! Parsley? He spends a lot of time behind the Wealthy Jackal!

MARIE: I can take you, if you want!
