AINSLEY: Alright, Oakewood!
AINSLEY: If you go check it out, I'll bet you five months of scavenging that you've never seen anything like it before.

OAKEWOOD: Uh, no. You are delusional and I have a life.

OAKEWOOD: And that involves a nice, cozy night in away from pestering nutjobs like you.

OAKEWOOD: And speaking of, time to leave.

AINSLEY: You'd throw me to the wolves?
OAKEWOOD: Some of my best friends are wolves. Out.
