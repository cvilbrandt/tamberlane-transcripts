BRIAR: I hate to break it to you, Reno, but none of those stories are true.
BRIAR: They make it up for marketing.

BRIAR: In his heyday, Papa was circulating a story about how he broke his antler off in Death's own heart.
BRIAR: I'm _pretty sure_ that didn't happen.

RENO: Bast, back me up. _You_ know it's real, right?

BAST: I love you guys? But you're all muscle heads.
BAST: That's what I think.

WANDERER: Pow! Right to the heart!
RENO: You're just jealous of my buff cranium.
BAST: Oh I'm _sure._
